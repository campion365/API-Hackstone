#Project Summary:
I built this app to serve as a basic day planner-esque resource providing information that most people find important: 
*    Weather information to help inform how to dress and what to bring to work (example y/n to needing an umbrella) 
AND
* Recipe ideas for lunch at work and/or dinner
    *Dinner would help inform what someone may need to purchase from a grocery store on the way home
    
* Overarching idea is that the app could one day be monetized by advertiser sponsorship and inclusion from a variety of industries. For instance, a food manufacturer could substitute recipes/meals using its items, or perhaps a clothing company could provide clothing ideas based on weather and we then integrate into results.
